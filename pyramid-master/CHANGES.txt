==========

Features
--------

- Added an execution policy hook to the request pipeline. An execution
  policy has the ability to control creation and execution of the request
  objects before they enter rest of the pipeline. This means for a given
  request that the policy may create more than one request for retry
  purposes. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2964

Bug Fixes
---------

- HTTPException's accepts a detail kwarg that may be used to pass additional
  details to the exception. You may now pass objects so long as they have a
  valid __str__ method. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2951

- Fix a reference cycle causing memory leaks in which the registry
  would keep a ``Configurator`` instance alive even after the configurator
  was discarded. Another fix was also added for the ``global_registries``
  object in which the registry was stored in a closure preventing it from
  being deallocated. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/2967

- Fix a bug directly invoking ``pyramid.scripts.pserve.main`` with the
  ``--reload`` option in which ``sys.argv`` is always used in the subprocess
  instead of the supplied ``argv``.
